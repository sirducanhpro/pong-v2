                <p>This is a Pong game <br>
                    It is inspired by Allan Alcorn's 1972 Pong game. Read more about the game here <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong"> Pong Game</a><br>
                    I intend to implement more feaures to the game that would enhance it. Such features may include an A.I, more unique ball designs, different graphics..

                </p>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The objective is to score as many points as possible by not letting the ball touch your edge </li>
                    <li>Players must move the paddle that reflect the ball</li>
                    <li>You can change the directions of the paddle up and dow using either W,S or UP and DOWN arrow key.</li>
                </ul>
